Welcome to my Bowling project!

The project implements the bowling scoreboard.
Multiple players are supported, and the ability to set names for them.
The score is updated every roll,
the frame score is not shown until the frame is completed and the bonuses for strikes and spares are applied, as in a real game of bowling.
Splits and fouls are not supported.

The project uses REST API to communicate with front end.
API includes scoreboard, that has player names, frames, rolls for each frame, score for each frame, and overall score.
API also includes errors to communicate error id and description to the front end.
